ATTENTION â€“ BASED IMAGE CAPTIONING WITH PROGRESSIVE GROWING GANs
Problem Definition: 
In recent years, both attention-based image captioning models and Progressive Growing GANs have individually demonstrated significant advancements in their respective domains of computer vision and generative modelling. However, there remains a gap in leveraging the complementary strengths of these techniques to create a more nuanced and contextually rich image captioning system. The problem at hand is to develop a novel approach that combines attention-based image captioning with Progressive Growing GANs to generate accurate and detailed textual descriptions for high-resolution synthetic images.
Project Overview:
The project focuses on developing text for the images which are being displayed with the help of progressive growing GANs. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning framework and is prominent for approaching Generative AI. Incorporating attention mechanisms into the image captioning model to effectively highlight relevant features within the generated images. Ensuring that the attention mechanism adapts dynamically to the progressive growth of GAN-generated images.
Solution and its Proposition:
The proposed solution aims to produce a state-of-the-art image captioning system capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant captions for high-resolution synthetic images.
By combining attention mechanisms with Progressive Growing GANs, we expect to achieve significant improvements in caption quality, coherence, and relevance, leading to enhanced user experience and applications across various domains.
Modelling:
1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect an image of the category which is needed to be transformed into Textual format and preprocess the image data. 
2.	Feature Extraction: Extract the relevant features from the preprocessed image. The common features include attention mechanism, encoder-decoder architecture, progressive growing mechanism and pre-trained models and transfer learning. 
3.	Model Selection: Particularly, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are being used.
Conclusion:
In this study, the progressive growing mechanism of PGGANs, you would expect to generate high-quality, realistic images with fine details and textures. These images would resemble real photographs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAN model in capturing and synthesizing visual content. The attention mechanism in the image captioning model would allow for the generation of contextually relevant captions for the generated images. These captions would accurately describe the content of the images, focusing on relevant objects, scenes, and concepts depicted in the visual data.
